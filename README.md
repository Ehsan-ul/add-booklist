<p>Here, you'll find an input field for Book Name, Author Name, and ISBN. After clicking the Submit Button, all these will be recorded in local storage and will be shown in the table format below the submit button. You can delete the book item from both UI and server. A pop-up alert div will rise when you add a book or even delete it. Also, you will be notified, even if you didn't fill any of the input fields.</p>
